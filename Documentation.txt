Purpose:

This code aims to create a Streamlit web application for language translation using AI. The application allows users to input text, select source and target languages, and translate the text dynamically.

Key Concepts:
1.	Streamlit: Streamlit is a Python library for building interactive web applications with minimal code. It provides easy-to-use components for creating UI elements and connecting them to Python code.
2.	Transformers Library: The code utilizes the Transformers library (from Hugging Face), which provides access to pre-trained language models and pipelines for natural language processing tasks, including translation.
3.	Language Translation Pipeline: The pipeline function from the Transformers library is used to create a translation pipeline, which translates text from a source language to a target language using pre-trained translation models.
4.	User Interface (UI): Streamlit components such as st.text_area and st.selectbox are used to create the user interface for inputting text and selecting languages.

Function Documentation:
•	languageselect(src_dest): Creates a select box for language selection (source or destination) and returns the selected language code.
•	translate(text, source_language, target_language): Translates text from the source to the target language using the Transformers pipeline and returns the translated text.

Usage:
•	Run the script to start the Streamlit web application.
•	Input text to be translated in the text area.
•	Select source and target languages from the dropdown menus.
•	Click the "Translate" button to see the translated text.
•	Click the "Shut Down" button to exit the application.

Dependencies:
•	Streamlit (streamlit): Python library for building web applications.
•	Transformers (transformers): Python library for accessing pre-trained language models.

Further Considerations:
•	Customize the UI elements and styling to improve the user experience.
•	Explore additional features and capabilities of the Transformers library for more advanced translation tasks.
•	Ensure compatibility and performance optimization for deployment in production environments.
